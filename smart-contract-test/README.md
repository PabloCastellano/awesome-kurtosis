## Smart Contract Test Example

This example demonstrates how Kurtosis can be used for smart contract dapp development 
by using the [`eth-network-package`](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/eth-network-package) as a local ethereum network. 
The `eth-network package` can be used as a low overhead, configurable, and composable alternative to services like
`hardhat-network` and `anvil`.
